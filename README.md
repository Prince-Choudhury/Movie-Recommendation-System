# Movie Recommender System

A Machine Learning-based movie recommender system using movie metadata and content-based filtering.

## Description

This application recommends movies based on the selected movie using a **content-based recommendation system**. The app fetches movie details like the poster and title for a personalized movie recommendation experience.

### Features:
